# Rant about AWS

AWS is like a big ocean with 200+ services like EC2, S3, RDS etc., each of them with a tons of features. AWS does spend a lot of effort and money around innovation. AWS has really fascinated me.

It's tough to keep up with AWS. This is an attempt to consolidate my learnings and findings around AWS. This is also to make sure one is motivated and also learn more about AWS. I would be adding more and more to this project, so keep looking around.

Also, I have written a good number of blogs/articles on Big Data, AWS and Kubernetes on my blog [https://www.thecloudavenue.com/](https://www.thecloudavenue.com/).

Feel free to submit any pull requests for any changes to the documentation or the code.

Good Luck !!!
