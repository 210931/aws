# Rant about AWS

AWS is a big ocean with 200+ services like EC2, S3, RDS etc. with tons of features in each of this. This is an attempt consolidate my learnings and findings around AWS. This is also to make sure one is motivated and also learn more about AWS. I would be adding more and more to this project, so keep looking around.

Also, I have written a good number of blogs/articles on Big Data, AWS and Kubernetes on my blog [https://www.thecloudavenue.com/](https://www.thecloudavenue.com/).

Good Luck !!! Feel free to submit any pull requests for any changes to the documentation or the code.
